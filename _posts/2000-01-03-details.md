# Get It!

### `sudo pip3 install coala-bears`

You can install coala without any bears, just the bare framework, with
`sudo pip3 install coala`.

If the installation doesn't work for you, check out <http://coala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Users/Install.html#installation-errors>.

-------------------------

# Try It!

### `cd project && coala --files="**/*.py" --bears=PEP8Bear --save`

### Your configuration will be automatically saved to the `.coafile` in the current directory. Go to <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/bear-docs/blob/master/README.rst> to see what bears are available. Bears can be installed as pip packages.

-------------------------

# Commit It!

### `git add .coafile && git commit -m "Add coala configuration"`
